# üìë SFSE Plugin Template
Native dll plugin for [starfield script extender](https://github.com/ianpatt/sfse).

[Create a new plugin project from this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=SF_PluginTemplate&template_owner=gottyduke) 

## ‚öô Requirements

- [CMake 3.26+](https://cmake.org/)
  - Add this to your `PATH`
- [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest)
- [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
  - Add the environment variable `VCPKG_ROOT` with the value as the path to the folder containing vcpkg
  - Make sure your local vcpkg port is up-to-date by pulling the latest and do `vcpkg integrate install`
- [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
  - Desktop development with C++
- [Starfield Steam Distribution](#-deployment)
  - Add the environment variable `SFPath` with the value as the path to the game installation
  
## Get started

### üíª Register Visual Studio as a Generator

- Open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt`
- Run `cmake`
- Close the cmd window

### üî® Building

- [CommonLibSF](https://github.com/Starfield-Reverse-Engineering/CommonLibSF)
- [DKUtil](https://github.com/gottyduke/DKUtil)
> These two dependencies can either be local fork (by specifying `CommonLibSFPath` and `DKUtilPath`) or via git submodule(`update-submodule.bat`).
> If having multiple projects, to avoid having copies of CommonLibSF and DKUtil in each of them, it's suggested to use the local fork and environment path approach, so all projects share the same package.

```
.\make-sln-msvc.bat
cmake --build build
```

### üì¶ Deployment

This plugin template comes with a simple custom deployer script to enable custom distribution rules fitting most use cases.  
To get started on adding custom deploy rules, check out the [default examples](Plugin/dist/rules).  
| action    | usage                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `base`    | set variable `params[0]` with value `params[1]`              |
| `copy`    | copy `params[0]` to `params[1]`                              |
| `copy_if` | do `copy` if file exists                                     |
| `package` | add `params[0..-1]` list of sources to zip file `params[-1]` |
| `remove`  | remove `params` list of sources                              |
| `script`  | execute raw powershell script                                |


The following base variables are provided by default:
```
cmake_output    // this is the binary output path
dist            // this is the dist folder path, also the working directory of deployer script
project_name    // project name same as CMakeLists
project_version // project version same as CMakeLists
```

Deploy actions can be enabled by build configuration(`debug`, `release`, `relwithdebinfo`, etc)
